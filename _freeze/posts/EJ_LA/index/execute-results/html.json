Although many of the reforms in the New Deal were successful, others were extremely discriminatory. During this time, the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created. This agency was designed to help with the housing crisis and prevent foreclosures through refinancing. This involved lenders and real estate agents grading the investment risks of neighborhoods. Unfortunately, these grades were heavily based on racial and socioeconomic makeup. \n\nGrades included:\n\n- Grade A (the most desirable)\n- Grade B (still desirable)\n- Grade C (declining in desirability)\n- Grade D (least desirable and hazardous)\n\nLower grades were given to neighborhoods that were majority black, minorities, immigrants, or poor whites. This prevented people of color from moving to majority white neighborhoods and greatly financially impacted homeowners of color. (https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2019/19-0600_misc_5-6-19.pdf)\n\nAlthough redlining was outlawed in the 1968 Fair Housing Act, many effects of redlining have continued to present day. In this project, I mapped and explored the graded makeup of LA as well as biodiversity in previously redlined districts in present day. \n\n## Set-Up \n\n#### Read In Libraries and Data\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell quiet='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(testthat)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell quiet='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in data\nejscreen <- sf::st_read(here::here(\"posts\", \"EJ_LA\", \"data\", \"ejscreen\",\"EJSCREEN_2023_BG_StatePct_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI.gdb\")) \n\nbirds <- sf::st_read(here::here(\"posts\", \"EJ_LA\",\"data\", \"gbif-birds-LA\", \"gbif-birds-LA.shp\"))\n\nholc <- sf::st_read(here::here(\"posts\", \"EJ_LA\",\"data\", \"mapping-inequality\", \"mapping-inequality-los-angeles.json\")) %>%\n  filter(st_is_valid(.))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Data Wrangling \n\nIn order to effectively explore the effects of redlining, we need to zoom in on a specific area.

With the information and skill set provided at the moment, the percentage error is cautiously overlooked*\n\nMapping HOLC grades in LA greatly helps to visualize the redlining present in the early to mid 1900s. In order to look at one of the many lasting effects of redlining, let's first look at the connection between the percent of low income population, particulate matter concentrations, and low life expectancy percentiles in each grade.\n\n### Current Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Join data sets and drop geometry to get summary stats\nsum_stats <- st_join(holc_transform, LA, join = st_intersects) |>\n  st_drop_geometry() \n\n# Plot box plots with means for low income, PM 2.5, and life exp. \nlow_inc <- ggplot(sum_stats, aes(grade,LOWINCPCT, fill = grade))+\n  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  stat_summary(fun =mean, geom =\"point\", shape=20, size=6, color=\"pink\", fill=\"pink\") +\n    theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Set1\") +\n  labs(x = \"HOLC Grades\",\n       y = \"Percent of Low Income Population\",\n       caption = \"     * Mean of each box plot\\n represented by a pink circle\",\n       title = \"Income, Particulate Matter Concentrations,\\nand Life Expectancy Disparities by HOLC Grade\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nPM_p <- ggplot(sum_stats, aes(grade,P_PM25, fill = grade))+\n  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  stat_summary(fun =mean, geom =\"point\", shape=20, size=6, color=\"pink\", fill=\"pink\") +\n    theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Set1\") +\n  labs(x = \"HOLC Grades\",\n       y = \"Percentile of PM 2.5 Concentrations\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nlow_life <- ggplot(sum_stats, aes(grade,P_LIFEEXPPCT, fill = grade))+\n  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  stat_summary(fun =mean, geom =\"point\", shape=20, size=6, color=\"pink\", fill=\"pink\") +\n    theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Set1\") +\n  labs(x = \"HOLC Grades\",\n       y = \"Percentile of Low Life Expectancy\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# View patchworked plots\nprint(low_inc + PM_p + low_life)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the figures is not surprising, it follows a pattern in each plot. In all cases we see here, the D grade HOLC areas have the highest values, meaning that they have the highest percentage of low income, the highest percentage of low life expectancy, and the highest percentile of PM 2.5 concentrations. As the grades go up, the low income, PM concentrations, and low life expectancy goes down.\n\nUnfortunately, it's still clear to see how redlined districts continue to impact quality of life in low graded neighborhoods. We can also see the effects of redlining through biodiversity disparities. We will introduce data on bird observations in LA, and then examine whether there is a pattern between observations and HOLC grades.\n\n## Part 2: Legacy of redlining in biodiversity observations\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check coordinate reference system\nprint(st_crs(birds) == st_crs(holc_transform))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Change coordinate system for birds to match holc_transform\nbirds_transform <- st_transform(birds, crs = st_crs(holc_transform))\n\n# Check that it works\nif(st_crs(birds_transform) == st_crs(LA)){\n  print(\"it's a match!\")\n} else {\n  warning(\"not a match, check your coordinate systems!\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"it's a match!\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# filter to 2022\nbirds_2022 <- birds_transform |>\n  filter(year == 2022)\n\n# check that years are correct\nexpect_true(unique(birds_2022$year) == 2022)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Join bird data into HOLC data\nbird_redline <- st_join(holc_transform, birds_2022, join = st_intersects)\n\n# Group birds by grades\ngrade_bird <- bird_redline |> \n  st_drop_geometry() |>\n  group_by(grade) |>\n  summarize(obs_percent = n()/nrow(bird_redline)*100)\n\n# Recalculate by area\narea_holc_bird <- bird_redline |>\n  group_by(grade) |>\n  summarize(total_area = sum(area, na.rm = TRUE),\n            grade_count = n()) |>\n  mutate(bird_count_area = grade_count/total_area) |>\n  select(grade, bird_count_area) |>\n  st_drop_geometry()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Create plot\npercent_plot <- ggplot(grade_bird) +\n  geom_col(aes(x = grade, y = obs_percent, fill = grade), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Grades\",\n       y = \"Percent of Bird Observations\",\n       title = \"Percent of Bird Observations\\n in HOLC Grades\",\n       caption = \"     * this graph does not take\\n into account varying HOLC area sizes\")\n\n# Create plot\narea_plot <- ggplot(area_holc_bird) +\n  geom_col(aes(x = grade, y = bird_count_area, fill = grade), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  labs(x = \"Grades\",\n       y = \"Bird Observations by area\",\n       title = \"Bird Observations by Area Size\\n of HOLC Grades\")\n\n# View plots\nprint(percent_plot + area_plot)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, it looks like the percent of bird observations in HOLC graded areas are counter intuitive. It looks as if C and D have the highest percentage of bird observations, which goes completely against what we would expect. Ellis-Soto et all writes that historically redlined districts are under sampled in terms of bird diversity. Why is our data different? When looking at the map of HOLC grades, the answer is clear, there is significantly more areas with A and B grades. This means that although there are more bird observations in A and B areas, their percentages are lower because they cover more area. To look at how the bird observations actually change by grade, we recalculated the bird data to account for the size of the HOLC graded areas. When looking at the second figure, it lines up with Ellis-Soto et al. Although the pattern is not perfect, the D grade does have the lowest observations by far. \n\nThis project only begins to touch on the environmental and socioeconomic lasting impacts of redlining in LA and over the entirety of the US. This project was led by Dr. Ruth Oliver in a graduate level Geospatial Analysis class at the Bren School for Environmental Science and Management at UCSB. \n\n### Citation\n\n| Data                          | Citation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Link                                                      |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| EJ Screen Data                | EPA.
